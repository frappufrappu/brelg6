Rudimentary minigame to learn meteor placement in brel g6


- The toggle top left turns on/off night mode
- You should click on the Top Golden Meteor button to start the simulation
- There are tips that suggest you when and where to drop the meteors, but these follow the pacing of a group with decent dps, so ignore them if your party is pushing very slowly
- Tiles become slightly darker the less hp they have, and they turn black when there are "destroyed"
- Tiles "respawn" 5 seconds after they were destroyed, but you can change that cooldown at the top
- You can "wipe" if you break the center tile, or more than 4 tiles
- If you wipe, make sure to click the Reset button to restore the HP of the middle tile (because its get back 3 HP when it respawns instead of 14 and my lazy ass didn't fix that)
